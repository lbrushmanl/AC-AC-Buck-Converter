D The HIP2210 is a 100V, 3A source, 4A sink high-frequency half-bridge NMOS FET driver. The HIP2210 features a tri-level PWM input with programmable dead time. Its wide operating supply range of 6V to 18V and integrated high-side bootstrap diode supports driving the high-side and low-side NMOS in 100V half-bridge applications.This driver features strong 3A source, 4A sink drivers with very fast 15ns typical propagation delay and 2ns typical delay matching, making it optimal for high-frequency switching applic
